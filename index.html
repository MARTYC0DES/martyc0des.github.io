    <h1> Custom Mechanical Keyboards</h1>
    <p>Over the past few years I have grown extremely fond 
        of building mechanical keyboards. There is so much to learn about them.
        The best part is when the keyboard sounds great to the press of a key, making 
        a loud <strong> 'THOCK' </strong> sound. If you would like to learn about keyboards
